# midnightRust
Repository for chatting and learning about Rust after work.

## What is MidnightRust?
This event is to make the last time at night time after work. It is quite difficult to learn about Rust habitually and continuously while working or studying on a regular basis. It is hard to motivate yourself to study when you go home after work with a tired body. Perhaps you have housework and childcare waiting for you after work. The purpose of this event is to make it possible for you to enjoy, fulfill, continue, and naturally make a habit of Rust in your scarce time

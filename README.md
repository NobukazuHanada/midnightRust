# midnightRust
Repository for chatting and learning about Rust after work.

## What is MidnightRust?
This event is to make the last time at night time after work. It is quite difficult to learn about Rust habitually and continuously while working or studying on a regular basis. It is hard to motivate yourself to study when you go home after work with a tired body. Perhaps you have housework and childcare waiting for you after work. The purpose of this event is to make it possible for you to enjoy, fulfill, continue, and naturally make a habit of Rust in your scarce time

## Who is hosting the event?
Anyone can do it! Starting at 21:00 Japan time I do this event every week utilizing the twitter space function, but you don't have to follow this format. The organizer may choose the time of day appropriately, and any platform can be used.

I hope everyone will feel free to do this. It doesn't matter who does it or what it is, as long as it is an event where you can continue to learn and stay motivated.
